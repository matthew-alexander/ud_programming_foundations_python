Jennifer scowled. “Why can't we go to the park today?” Her mom calmly replied; “I have work to do around the house, and your Dad has the car. Jennifer looked out the window. It was Saturday and the sun was shining, the birds were singing, but she couldn't go to the park. What a rotten day.  “You can play in the garden,” Jennifer's Mom suggested. Jennifer sighed. “I guess.” She took her pink sweater off its hook and put it on. Then she slowly made her way outside. Near the front of the house, Mom's Hydrangeas were in full bloom. Jennifer's whole family loved plants. Jennifer had a little patch of her own where she grew strawberries, pansies, and elephants ears. Jennifer made her way down the garden path to her dad's patch of garden, where he had carnivorous plants like Venus Flytraps and Sundews.  She squatted and studied one of the Venus Flytrap's  traps. It was like a green clam shell with a pink inside and long tusks on the rim. She dared not put her finger in it or else the trap would clamp down it's jaws on her. Another one of the traps was closed and had a piece of iridescent film sticking out of it. This, she knew was the wing of an insect.  She rubbed her finger on the outside of the trap. This, she knew would help it digest the bug. She walked over to her plant patch. There were three juicy berries on her strawberry plant. Jennifer picked each one and plopped them in her mouth. “Mmm!” She said, enjoying the juicy, sweet fruit.
